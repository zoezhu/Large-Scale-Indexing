# Large-Scale-Indexing
This is a program aiming to build indexing over very large corpus.
If we use tranditional method to create posting table while reading a large scale of documents, PC will be overwhelmed by overload memory usage. 

This program write the posting table to disk while reading data from documents, that relieves the memory storage.
